# Icecream-vending-machine-prototype

Problem statement: 
Due to huge population in india, vending machines are rare in india. 
What if there's a vending machine which dispenses ice cream 24*7 without human intervention?

Design:
An arduino will be connected to relays which will control the mechanical components.
In this prototype, only the electronic control is implemented. End to end testing of code is done by connecting aurdino with LEDs(replacing mechanical components). 

Place the circuit as per the LED numbers present in the code. Deploy this prototype in Arduino software and run.
